          We are a group of seven students from Aalborg University. MCGA which is focused on grid computing, aims to
          create an efficient, secure, and incentivized
          platform that allows users to share their CPU power in a controlled and rewarding way. Through MCGA, we hope
          to empower individuals to contribute
          to large-scale computing efforts while maintaining full control over their resources.

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
          MCGA is an extension that allows users to contribute their CPU power to a distributed computing network. The
          extension runs in the background,
          so you won't experience any disruption to your regular activities. In return for your contribution,
          you receive rewards based on the amount of power you share. The system tracks your usage transparently, so you
          can see how your resources are being used
          and monitor the rewards you earn. MCGA is designed to be secure, flexible, and rewarding, making it easy and
          beneficial for users to take part in the grid computing network.

        <h1>Security of Data</h1>

          The team behind MCGA understands the importance of trust in a collaborative computing environment.
          Our platform offers users complete control over how much CPU power they contribute,
          ensuring flexibility and transparency in their involvement. By rewarding users for their
          contributions with clear and fair incentives, a system that values both effort and trust is created.
          Security measures are taken to protect users' systems and data, while our transparent
          tracking system allows users to see exactly how their resources are being utilized. This combination of
          autonomy,
          reward, and security makes our platform a reliable choice for users who want to participate in grid computing
          while maintaining control over their resources.
